1. FlexWord Sound Philosophy (Design Doc)
Core Principle
Silent-first. Expressive by choice. Accessible by design.
FlexWord is designed to be comfortably playable:
in public
at work
late at night
without headphones
Sound is never required to play or succeed.
Philosophy Pillars
1. Silent by Default
All sound effects are OFF by default
No surprise audio
No background music
This matches player expectations set by Wordle and other daily word games.
2. Sound = Confirmation, Not Stimulation
Sound is used only to:
confirm actions
signal outcomes
reinforce success
Sound is never used to punish, rush, or distract.
3. Accessibility Is a First-Class Use Case
Sound effects are designed to:
supplement color feedback
support low-vision and colorblind players
work alongside screen readers
Audio is descriptive, not decorative.
4. Player Control Above All
Players can:
enable/disable sound at any time
control sound effects independently of system volume
play the entire game without audio
No gameplay advantage is tied to sound.
Non-Goals (Explicit)
FlexWord does not aim to:
create a musical identity
provide ambient audio
gamify sound
compete for attention via audio
Quiet confidence > noise.
2. Sound Events Specification (Implementation-Ready)
Below is a minimal, intentional sound event list.
If an event is not listed here, it should not make sound.
Global Rules
All sounds:
< 300ms
low-volume
soft attack / fast decay
No overlapping sounds
Respect system mute
Core Gameplay Events
🔹 Contract Accepted
Sound: soft “confirm” click
Purpose: acknowledges commitment
Frequency: once per contract
Optional: yes
🔹 Guess Submitted (Valid)
Sound: very light tap / tick
Purpose: confirmation only
Do NOT: differentiate correctness here
🔹 Guess Rejected (Invalid Word)
Sound: muted thud or soft buzz
Purpose: indicate rejection without punishment
Accessibility: paired with text explanation
🔹 Contract Completed – Success
Sound: gentle ascending chime
Purpose: reward & closure
Haptic: optional light pulse
This is the most important sound
🔹 Contract Failed
Sound: none OR extremely subtle neutral tone
Purpose: avoid negative reinforcement
Text handles clarity
🔹 Bank / Payout Credited
Sound: quiet “coin settle” (not a jingle)
Purpose: reinforce progress
Never looped
Accessibility-Only Audio (Optional Toggle)
🔸 Result Summary Readout
When enabled:
“Three letters correct. Two misplaced.”
Spoken via screen reader
Triggered after guess evaluation
Replaces reliance on color alone
🔸 Daily Contract Completion Summary
“Contract complete. Risky tier. Four guesses used.”
This is huge for blind and low-vision players.
Explicitly No Sound For:
typing letters
deleting letters
tile flips
sandbox play loops
leaderboards
menus (unless accessibility mode is on)
3. Accessibility Notes (Reddit / App Review Ready)
You can publish this almost verbatim.
